public Member hashSearchById(String id) {
    return memberHashMap.get(id);
}
```

// Cache sorted results to avoid re-sorting
private List<Member> cachedSortedByRating;
private boolean cacheDirty = true;
```

try {
    // Risky operation
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // Specific file handling
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    // Data format errors
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Generic fallback
} finally {
    // Cleanup operations
}
```

### Error Recovery Mechanisms
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with reduced functionality
